    This talk includes three parts:
    <ul>
      <li>First, I introduce the basics of neural architecture search (NAS), including background, motivation, problem definition.</li>
      <li>Then, I give an overview of NAS researches, organized by research questions, i.e., “what to search”, “how to search”, “what does the search tell us”. I summarize existing solutions to solve these questions.</li>
      <li>Finally, I introduce my researches that utilize architecture encoding to answer “how to search” along two directions, i.e., accelerate exploration and improve evaluation.</li>
    </ul>
    The talk is in Chinese, and the English-version video will soon be available.
