  text: 'Our paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00945" target="_blank" style="color: #0c53a5;">Efficient Expert Pruning for Sparse Mixture-of-Experts Language Models: Enhancing Performance and Reducing Inference Costs</a> is public on arXiv. We conduct expert pruning of MoE models and use weight merging to inherit the knowledge from the retrained and discarded experts. This is a novel and gradient-free way to inherit the knowledge during model compression. The code will soon be available at <a href="https://github.com/imagination-research/EEP" target="_blank" style="color: #0c53a5;">code</a>.'

  text: 'Our paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14629" target="_blank" style="color: #0c53a5;">Can LLMs Learn by Teaching? A Preliminary Study</a> is public on arXiv. We make the first attempt in adapting the "learning by teach" strategy in education into LLMs and see if the contemporary LLMs are ready to learn by teach to improve the outcome or ability for mathematical reasoning and code synthesis. The results show some promise. We also provide a roadmap for future research.

MoA compresses attention in LLMs, so that they can compute short attention, but remember long context. It achieves 5.5-6.7x faster throughput than dense FlashAttention2, improving retrieval accuracy by 1.5-7.1x compared to uniform sparse attention.

  text: 'Our paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08552" target="_blank" style="color: #0c53a5;">DiTFastAttn: Attention Compression for Diffusion Transformer Models</a> is public on arXiv. We design three training-free techniques to compress the attention operation, which is the efficiency bottleneck when generating large-resolution images. For example, applying DiTFastAttn to PixArt-Sigma-XL can reduce the FLOPs and latency of attention computation by 88% and 37% when generating 2Kx2K images.

  text: 'Our two papers are public on arXiv. In the first paper, we propose <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17873" target="_blank" style="color: #0c53a5;">MixDQ: Memory-Efficient Few-Step Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Metric-Decoupled Mixed Precision Quantization</a> that successfully tackles the challenging few-step text-to-image diffusion model quantization. With negligible visual quality degradation and content change, MixDQ could achieve W4A8, equivalent to 3.4x memory compression and 1.5x latency speedup. Check our <a href="https://github.com/A-suozhang/MixDQ" target="_blank" style="color: #0c53a5;">code</a> and <a href="https://a-suozhang.xyz/mixdq.github.io/" target="_blank" style="color: #0c53a5;">project page</a>. The second paper is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02540v1" target="_blank" style="color: #0c53a5;">ViDiT-Q: Efficient and Accurate Quantization of Diffusion Transformers for Image and Video Generation</a>, a quantization method specialized for the transformer-based video & image diffusion models. For popular large-scale models (e.g., open-sora, Latte, Pixart) for the video and image generation task, ViDiT-Q could achieve W8A8 quantization without metric degradation, and W4A8 without notable visual quality degradation.

This work proposes a method, Linear Combination of Saved Checkpoints (LCSC). LCSC uses gradient-free search-based checkpoint combination to obtain the final weights, achieving significant training speedups (23x on CIFAR-10 and 15x on ImageNet-64) compared to full gradient-based training. LCSC can be used to enhance pre-trained models with a small cost. Check our <a href="https://github.com/imagination-research/LCSC" target="_blank" style="color: #0c53a5;">code</a>.'
