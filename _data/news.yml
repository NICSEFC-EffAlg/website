  text: 1 papers, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18158" target="_blank">QLLM-Eval</a>, is accepted by ICML'24. This work evaluates 11 LLM families, different tasks (including emergent abilities, dialogue, long-context tasks, and so on), and different tensor types (Weight, Weight-Activation, Key-Value Cache). We provide quantative suggestions and qualitative insights on the quantization. Practitioners could benefit from this work with a full scope of quantization suggestions.

  text: 2 papers are acccepted by ICLR'24. One is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15337" target="_blank">Skeleton-of-Thoughts</a>, which accelerates LLM generation by letting the LLM itself to plan and generate segments in parallel, achieving ~2x speed-ups; Another is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07243" target="_blank">USF</a>, which summarizes the sampling strategies for diffusion and search for the best sampling strategy. Congrats and thanks to the collaborators and students.
